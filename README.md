# AI-Agents Project

## Project Overview
The AI-Agents project aims to build AI workflows to replace the tedious and time-consuming tasks in our lives. Our target audience is every human being. I firmly believe that AI is a tool to enhance personal productivity, capable of taking over part or even an entire field of work. While creating wealth, it will liberate people at the end of the productivity chain. In the future, low-end, low-value, and mundane jobs will be performed by AI, thus freeing humans from poverty and busyness.

## Project Vision
For this great endeavor, I am willing to contribute my part voluntarily. I will delegate the tedious tasks in my life to AI, which is a good start. I believe AI will generate significant wealth and make people in all industries marvel: wow, this AI is truly remarkable!

## Project Goals
Apart from selling courses, providing AI code, and AI customer service, what else can we do? Let's bring AI from ideals to reality; we need this kind of madness.
